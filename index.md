## Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University

The Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University helps governments build capacity for decision making that is rooted in evidence, transparent accountability, and citizen engagement. The interdisciplinary center is part of the universityâ€™s 21st Century Cities Initiative, a cross-disciplinary research effort for urban study and change.

We educate governments about best practices for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data, helping them to better assess job functions, improve service delivery, decrease waste, and engender public trust.
